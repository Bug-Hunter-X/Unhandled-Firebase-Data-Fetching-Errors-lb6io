# Firebase Data Fetching Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase development: insufficient error handling when fetching data. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers an improved version with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem:

The original code lacks robust error handling for network issues or permission problems. This leads to app crashes or unexpected behavior if data retrieval fails.

## Solution:

The improved version includes:
- More informative error messages.
- Fallback mechanisms to prevent app crashes.
- Specific error handling for different Firebase error codes.
